# D&D Chef

This web app is a simple tracker for who's turn it is to cook for the best D&D group in the world.

To run the app locally, you'll want to first install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Once you've installed git, run `git clone https://github.com/JBiddle96/dnd-chef.git` to fetch the files. Navigate to the top level of the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. To run a local version of the website, run `npx vite` and navigate to the URL shown in the command line.
